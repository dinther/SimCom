# Demo EXE files for Windows

Just download these zip files and extract the content on your drive. EXE files are contained in a folder named after the zip file.

I have yet to write an installer for WASimcommander library so unfortunately you have to do that yourself for now:
[WASimcommander](https://github.com/mpaperno/WASimCommander)

Run Microsoft Flight Simulator first and then run the demo EXE.
